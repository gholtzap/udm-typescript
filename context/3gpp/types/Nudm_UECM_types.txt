Description 
|The identity the AMF uses to register in the NRF. A URI provided by the AMF to receive (implicitly subscribed) notifications on deregistration. The deregistration callback URI shall have unique information within AMF set to identify the UE to be deregistered. 
This IE shall contain the serving AMF's GUAMI. This IE shall indicate the current RAT type of the UE. 
See clause 6.2.8 
These are the features supported by the AMF. This flag indicates whether or not the AMF has deregistered. It shall not be included in the Registration service operation. 
Permanent Equipment Identifier. 
Absence of PEI indicates that the PEI is not available at the AMF. In this case the UDM/UDR shall not delete the PEI value stored from a previous registration. 
If the UDR supports the PeiResource feature, the UDM shall also use the Peilnfo resource of the UDR to store the received PEI if it is different from the previously stored PEI or if the Peilnfo resource does not exist. 
Indicates per UE if "IMS Voice over PS Sessions" is homogeneously supported in all TAs in the serving AMF for the current PLMN and access 
type, or homogeneously not supported, or if support is non-homogeneous/unknown. Absence of this attribute shall be interpreted as "non homogenous or unknown" support. 
When present, this IE shall contain the name of the AMF service to which the Deregistration 
Notification is to be sent (see clause 6.5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]). 
A URI provided by the AMF to receive (implicitly subscribed) notifications on the need for P-CSCF Restoration. 
When present, this IE shall contain the name of the AMF service to which P-CSCF Restoration Notifications are to be sent (see clause 6.5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]). This IE may be included if |pcscfRestorationCallbackUri is present. 
This IE shall be included by the AMF and set to true if the UE performs an Initial Registration. If the UE does not perform initial registration it shall be absent or set to false. When present and true, the UDM+HSS is requested to cancel previous registration in SGSN, if any. 
Not applicable for Nudr and Nudm_UECM GET operation. 
(NOTE 2) 
This IE shall be included by the AMF and set to true if the UE performs an emergency Registration. Not applicable for Nudr and Nudm_UECM GET operation. 
This IE shall be included if the NF service consumer is an AMF and the AMF supports the 
AMF management without UDSF. 
The UDM uses this attribute to do an NRF query in 
order to invoke later services in a backup AMF, e.g. Namf_EventExposure.

Dual Registration flag. When present and true, this flag indicates that the UDM+HSS is requested not to send S6a-CLR to the registered MME/SGSN (if any). Otherwise, the registered MME (if any) shall be cancelled. 
Not applicable for Nudr and Nudm_UECM GET operation. 
This IE indicates whether 
"UE_REACHABILITY_FOR_SMS" event or 
"UE_REACHABILITY_FOR_DATA" event for One- Time UE Activity notification (i.e. Max Number Of reports =1) with configuration 
"INDIRECT_REPORT" for this user has been subscribed or not: 
- true: the event has been subscribed 
- false, or absence of this attribute: the event for this user is currently not subscribed 
(NOTE 1) 
Shall be present if urrplndicator is true and the UDM has subscribed (e.g. on behalf of NEF) to ReachabilityReport event for "UE Reachability for DL Traffic" at the AMF to receive One-Time UE Activity notification. It contains the subscription Id URI allocated by the AMF as received by the UDM in the HTTP "Location" header of the Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe response. The UDM shall make use of the 
Nudr_DataRepository Update service operation (see 3GPP TS 29.504 [9]) to store the amfEeSubscription Id in the UDR. 
This IE shall be included if the AMF has determined per APN/DNN which PGW-C+SMF is selected for EPS interworking with N26 and the AMF supports EPS interworking of non-3GPP access. For each APN/DNN, only one PGW-C+SMF shall be selected by the AMF for EPS interworking. This IE indicates whether the UE supports 5G SRVCC: 
- true: 5G SRVCC is supported by the UE and AMF; 
- false, or absence of this attribute: 5G SRVCC is not supported. 
Time of Amf3GppAccessRegistration. 
Shall be present when used on Nudr. 
Address of the VGMLC 
This IE if present may contain e.g. the headers received by the UDM along with the Amf3GppAccessRegistration. 
Shall be absent on Nudm and may be present on Nudr 
This IE shall be absent on Nudr and may be present on Nudm. This indication is used by UDM to restore any possible ongoing subscription lost, as specified in clause 5.3.2.2.2. 
When present, this IE shall indicate whether AMF does not have event exposure subscriptions in UE Context: 
- true: No Event Exposure subscription existing in UE Context in AMF. 
- false: Event Exposure subscription(s) exist in UE Context in AMF. 
This IE may be included by the AMF in registration requests and should be included by UDM in GET responses when the corresponding GET request provided a GPSI UE identity.

This IE shall be present if the UE is currently not reachable (e.g. in not allowed areas) or the UE reachability is unknown (e.g. service restriction area of the UE is not received at the AMF during initial registration). 
When the UE is not reachable (and based on operator policy when the UE reachability is unknown), the UDM shall keep the urrplndicator and amfEeSubscriptionId attributes and not generate Reachability Report for the UE. 
Absence of this IE shall be interpreted as "REACHABLE". 
This IE is only applicable to Nudr interface and shall not be included over the Nudm interface. 
This attribute may be included in notifications sent by the UDR to the UDM if purgeFlag is also set to true in the same notification. 
When Nudr Data Change Notification is received including this attribute and the purge Flag, both set to true, the UDM uses 
"REREGISTRATION REQUIRED" as Deregistration Reason towards AMF. 
This attribute shall not be included and set to true if the adminDeregSubWithdrawn attribute is present and set to true. 
Absence of this IE shall be interpreted as false. This IE is only applicable to Nudr interface and shall not be included over the Nudm interface. 
This attribute may be included in notifications sent by the UDR to the UDM if the purgeFlag is also set to true in the same notification. 
When Nudr Data Change Notification is recevied including this attribute and the purge Flag, both set to true, the UDM uses 
"SUBSCRIPTION_WITHDRAWN" as Deregistration Reason towards AMF. 
This attribute shall not be included and set to true if the reRegistration Required attribute is present and set to true. 
Absence of this IE shall be interpreted as false. If present, it contains the URI where notifications about UDR-initiated data restoration shall be sent by UDM. 
May be present in registration response messages. The AMF may decide to re-register at the UDM when receiving a data restoration notification containing a matching resetld. 
Disaster Roaming Indicator (see 
3GPP TS 23.502 [3]). 
When present, this IE shall be set as follows: 
true: Disaster Roaming service is applied; false (default): Disaster Roaming service is not applied. 
This IE indicates whether the UE supports MINT: - true: MINT is supported by the UE; 
- false, or absence of this attribute: MINT is not supported.

May be present in request messages from the AMF to the UDM. 
If present: 
- true: indicates that the registration message sent by the AMF is due to a re-synchronization event, motivated by a previous reception at the AMF of a Data Restoration Notification from the UDM 
- false (or absent): indicates that this is a normal registration message (i.e., not motivated by a data restoration notification event) 
This IE is only applicable to the Nudm API and shall not be used on the Nudr API. 
It may only be included when "udrRestartInd" attribute is present and set to true. 
When present, it contains the timestamp 
(previously stored by AMF locally, after successful registration at UDM) when profiles in the AMF and in UDM/UDR were synchronized. 
NOTE 1: The urrpIndicator attribute shall only be exposed over the Nudr SBI, and it shall not be included by the AMF. NOTE 2: Regardless of the Dual Registration Flag, the SGSN, if any, is required to be cancelled (see
