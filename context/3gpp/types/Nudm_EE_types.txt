soon as one of the conditions is met. If the ReportMode is set to "PERIODIC", at least one of the
"maxNumOfReports" and "expiry" attributes shall be included.
NOTE 3 The information is only applicable to the event detected by a remote NF (e.g. AMF) and directly notified to

monitoring event as specified in clause 4.15.3.1 in
3GPP TS 23.502 [3].
When this event is subscribed by an NF service consumer, the
UDM subscribes to "ReachabilityReport" event for "UE
Reachability for DL Traffic" on the AMF.
When this event is subscribed by an NF service consumer, the
UDM shall request the AMF to directly send notification to NF,
if reachabilityForDataCfg is not present or indicates
"DIRECT_REPORT".
When this event is subscribed by an NF service consumer and
reachabilityForDataCfg indicates "INDIRECT_REPORT", the
UDM shall request the AMF to send notification via the UDM.
The Event is reported to an NF service consumer by the UDM
when a UE Activity notification or Nudm_UECM_Registration is
received from AMF, unless the AMF indicated in UECM
registration that UE is not reachable or the UE reachability is
unknown and UDM is configured to not report event based on
operator policy (see clause 5.3.2.2.2).
"UE_REACHABILITY_FOR_SMS" UE reachability for SMS, implements the "UE Reachability for
SMS Delivery" event as specified in clause 4.15.3.1 of
3GPP TS 23.502 [3].
This Event is reported when an SMSF is being registered in
UDM for the UE, or when a UE Activity notification is received
from AMF and there is an SMSF already registered for the UE.
This Event is also reported when a UE Activity notification or
Nudm_UECM_Registration is received from AMF regardless of
an SMSF being registered. when the request configuration is
for SMS over IP, unless the AMF indicated in UECM
registration that UE is not reachable or the UE reachability is
unknown and UDM is configured to not report event based on
operator policy (see clause 5.3.2.2.2).
This event only supports One-Time reporting.

type(s) of the UE or any UE in the group when AMF becomes
aware of the access type change of the UE.

"CONNECTIVITY_STATE_REPORT" The event is detected and reported by AMF (see
clause 6.2.6.3.3 of 3GPP TS 29.518 [36]).
A NF subscribes to this event via UDM to receive the current
connection management state of a UE or a group of UEs, and
report for updated connection management state of a UE or
any UE in the group when AMF becomes aware of a
connection management state change of the UE.
"TYPE_ALLOCATION_CODE_REPORT" The event is detected and reported by AMF (see
clause 6.2.6.3.3 of 3GPP TS 29.518 [36]).
A NF subscribes to this event via UDM to receive the TAC of a
UE or group of UEs.
"FREQUENT_MOBILITY_REGISTRATION
_REPORT"

clause 6.2.6.3.3 of 3GPP TS 29.518 [36]).
A NF subscribes to this event via UDM to receive the number
of mobility registration procedures during a period of a UE or
group of UEs.
"PDU_SES_REL" The event is detected and reported by SMF (see
clause 5.6.3.3 of 3GPP TS 29.508 [40]).
A NF subscribes to this event via UDM to receive event report
when a PDU session is released of a UE or group of UEs.
"PDU_SES_EST" The event is detected and reported by SMF (see
clause 5.6.3.3 of 3GPP TS 29.508 [40]).
A NF subscribes to this event via UDM to receive event report
when a PDU session is established of a UE or group of UEs.
"UE_MEMORY_AVAILABLE_FOR_SMS" The event is detected and reported by SMS-GMSC/IWMSC
(see clause 5.1.8 of 3GPP TS 29.540 [66]).

when UE memory capacity is exceeded.
