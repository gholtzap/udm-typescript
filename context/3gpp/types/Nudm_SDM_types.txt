Description 
A list of Single Nssais used as default. |(NOTE 1) (NOTE 2) (NOTE 3) (NOTE 4) 
List of non default Single Nssais. (NOTE 1) (NOTE 3) 
This attribute shall be present if the Nssai is sent to the AMF while reception has not yet been acknowledged from the UE; otherwise shall be absent. 
This attribute serves as Network Slicing Subscription Change Indication. 
A map (list of key-value pairs where singleNssai converted to string serves as key) of additional information related to this single Nssai. 
Indicates whether the AMF shall provide all subscribed S-NSSAIS to the UE not indicating support of subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network slices, even if these S-NSSAIS do not share a common NSSRG. 
true: indicates that the AMF shall provide all subscribed S-NSSAIS to the UE not indicating support of subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network slices. false: indicates that the AMF does not need to provide all subscribed S-NSSAls to the UE not indicating support of subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network slices. 
Applicability 
Nssaa, Nsac, Nssrg 
Nssrg 
NOTE 1: If the NF consumer does not support Nssaa optional feature, the UDM shall not include S-NSSAI(s) subject to Network Slice- Specific Authentication and Authorization in Get response messages, immediate reports within Subscribe response messages, or data change notifications where the data change is limited to S-NSSAI(s) subject to Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization. 
The total number of subscribed S-NSSAIs (including default S-NSSAIS and non-default S-NSSAIs) shall not exceed 16. NOTE 2: If NSSRG information is present in the subscription data, the default S-NSSAIs, if more than one is present, are associated 
with the same NSSRG values as defined in clause 5.15.12 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2]. NOTE 3: If NSSRG information is present, at least one NSSRG shall be associated with each of the S-NSSAls in the subscription 
information. 
NOTE 4: If the use case requires the UE to remain reachable at all times with at least one slice, it is recommended that at least one 
default S-NSSAI is not subject to network slice admission control, to avoid registration rejection in the case of no requested NSSAI was provided or none of the S-NSSAIS in the requested NSSAI was allowed (e.g. due to exceeding the maximum number of UEs configured for that S-NSSAI) as specified in clause 4.2.11.2 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3].

Description 
Identity of the NF Instance creating the subscription. 
If present with value true indicates that the subscription expires when the subscribing NF (AMF, SMF, SMSF) identified by the nflnstanceld ceases to be registered at the UDM. 
When the subscribing NF is an SMF, this 
means that the subscription is terminated by UDM when the last PDU session of such SMF is deregistered for a given SUPI. 
If the subscribing NF (AMF. SMF, SMSF) is not registered when the SDM subscription with implicitUnsubscribe indicator set to true is received by the UDM, the UDM should return a confirmed expiry time in the expires attribute to the subscribing NF even when the expires attribute is absent from the request. See NOTE 1. 
If present, indicates the point in time at which the subscription expires. Shall be present if implicitUnsubscribe is absent or false. 
Within a POST request the proposed expiry time is conveyed whereas in a POST response or PATCH response the confirmed expiry time is returned. 
URI provided by the NF service consumer to receive notifications 
When present, this IE shall contain the name of the AMF service to which Data Change Notifications are to be sent (see clause 6.5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]). This IE may be included if the NF service consumer is an AMF. A set of URIs that identify the resources for 
which a change triggers a notification. 
The URI shall take the form of either an 
absolute URI or an absolute-path reference as defined in IETF RFC 3986 [31]. 
See NOTE 3. 
Monitored Resource URIs should not contain query parameters. Instead, attributes within the SdmSubscription (e.g. singleNssai, dnn, plmnld) may be used for filtering. Received |query parameters may be ignored by the UDM. 
This IE may be present if the consumer is SMF. This attribute shall be also used as filter for the Nudr notifications when sdmSubscription is included in subscription DataSubscription in Nudr POST operation. 
See NOTE 2. 
This IE may be present if the consumer is SMF. This attribute shall be also used as filter for the Nudr notifications when sdmSubscription is included in subscription DataSubscription in Nudr POST operation. 
When present, this IE shall contain the Network Identifier only, or Wildcard DNN. 
See NOTE 2. 
This attribute shall be present if the SdmSubscription is sent in a GET response message on Nudr. It identifies the individual sdmSubscription stored in the UDR and may be used by the UDM to delete an expired or implicitly unsubscribed sdmSubscription.

This IE is used by Nudr_DataRepository API starting with 3GPP Rel-17 and onwards (see Table 5.2.3.3.1- 3 in 3GPP TS 29.505 [10]). If present, this IE contains information on the roaming restrictions. If this IE is absent e.g. if the UDR is not provisioned with the serving PLMN ID, then the UDM may use the UE's home subscribed profile as the default profile to handle the roaming and SNPN scenarios. Indicates whether the UE is allowed only for Remote Provisioning as specified in clause 5.30.2.10.3.2 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2]. UE subscription either allows, or does not allow the UE to access the PLMN as the Onboarding Network using PLMN credentials. 
false (default), or the attribute is absent: indicates that the UE is not restricted to the Onboarding only; 
true: indicates that the UE is allowed only for the Onboarding. 
Subscribed charging characteristics data associated to the subscription. 
3GPP TS 29.503 version 17.12.0 Release 17 
176 
NOTE 1: AccessAndMobilitySubscription Data can be UE-individual data or shared data. 
ETSI TS 129 503 V17.12.0 (2023-09) 
UE-individual data take precedence over shared data unless treatment instructions associated to the shared data indicate otherwise. 
E.g.: When an attribute of type array is present but empty within UE-Individual data and present (with any cardinality) in shared data and no treatment instructions are applicable, the empty array takes precedence. Similarly, when a nullable attribute is present with value null within the individual data and present (with any value) in shared data and no treatment instructions are applicable, the null value takes precedence (i.e. for the concerned UE the attribute is considered absent). 
NOTE 2: If the primaryRatRestrictions and secondaryRatRestrictions attributes are supported by the sender, the 
sender shall include the list of RAT Types that are restricted, if any, in the ratRestrictions attribute, shall include the list of RAT Types that are restricted for use as primary RAT, if any, in the primaryRatRestrictions attribute and shall include the list of RAT Types that are restricted for use as secondary RAT, if any, in the secondaryRatRestrictions attribute. If the primaryRatRestrictions and secondaryRatRestrictions attributes are supported by the receiver, the receiver shall use the data in the primaryRatRestrictions attribute, if received, as the list of RAT Types that are restricted for use as primary RAT, and shall use the data in the secondaryRat Restrictions attribute, if received, as the list of RAT Types that are restricted for use as secondary RAT, otherwise the receiver shall use the data in the ratRestrictions attribute, if received, as the list of RAT Types that are restricted. 
If the secondaryRatRestictions attribute is included in the subscription profile, the content may be sent to MME during inter RAT handover from NR SA to EN-DC, for the purpose of adequate SGW selection at MME based on subscription profile, and to avoid allocating unnecessary resources for secondary RAT at EPC if it is restricted. 
NOTE 3: The AMF shall take responsibility to perform PDU session related actions subject to change of 
OdbPacketService, e.g. release existing PDU session. 
NOTE 4: The UDM shall ignore the content of sorInfo received on Nudr if "sorafRetrieval" is set to true. NOTE 5: 
If multiple PDU sessions to one DNN and S-NSSAI are established in EPS, the AMF shall select the same PCF by configuration or by using existing method, e.g. same PCF selection in usage monitoring. NOTE 6: When UE is only permitted in a small area, i.e. the UE is forbidden in most of TAIs in the PLMN, AreaCode 
(e.g. "All TAls except xxx") may be used to avoid provisoning and transferring large number of TAIS. AeraCode may be used otherwise. 
NOTE 7: AreaCode for VPLMN(s) may be provisioned under agreement between operators.

This IE contains a bitmap,encoded as a base64 string, which indicates the broadcast location assistance data types for which the UE is subscribed to receive ciphering keys used to decipher broadcast assistance data. A bit set to 1 indicates that the UE is subscribed to receive ciphering keys applicable to corresponding positioning SIB type. 
The bits are ordered as following in the bitmap: 
first octet is the right-most octet. E.g. in "Ox0123", "first octet" would be "0x23" and "second octet" would be "Ox01" 
bit 1 is the right-most bit and bit 8 is the left-most bit in the octet. E.g. for octet "0x01", "bit 1" would be "1", and "bit 2" to "bit 8" would be "0" 
The mapping of the bits to the positioning SIB types is as follows: 
bit 8 in the first octet maps to positioning SIB Type 1-1 
—— 
bit 7 in the first octet maps to positioning SIB Type 1-2 
bit 6 in the first octet maps to positioning SIB Type 1-3
